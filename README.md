# Drupal-setup
This is a installation guide for setting up drupal using Docker Image and deploying it using Kubernetes and monitoring the logs using ELK.


# Install Docker
Step 1:-For starters, try to do an apt-get update.

Switch to root and run the below command

apt install -y docker.io


So with the above command,it has not only installed docker but also the group docker,setup users in the appropriate group and also setup the services upon bootup.Just to make sure your kubelet and docker are using the same group, we would create the following json file

vi /etc/docker/daemon.json

{
        "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
}

Step 2:-Add the docker group if it doesn't already exist,Add the connected user "$USER" to the docker group. Change the user name to match your preferred user if you do not want to use your current use.Once you do this, you can execute docker commands for non-root user without typing sudo


sudo groupadd docker

sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker

# Install Kubernetes

Step 1:- Add the key for the repo

curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -

Step 2:- Add the kubernetes sources

vi /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main

Step 3:- Do an update to grab the above sources

apt update

Step 4:- Install the 3 packages

apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl

Step 5:- Run kubeadm to get things started. Once you run the below command,you will get the token to join the worker nodes, keep it somewhere safely

kubeadm init â€“pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16



Step 6:- Exit from the root user, and run the below commands as normal user

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube

sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config

sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config


Step 7:- Install an etcd instance with the following command.

kubectl apply -f \
https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.2/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/etcd.yaml

Step 8:- Install the RBAC roles required for Calico

kubectl apply -f \
https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.2/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/rbac.yaml

Step 9:- Install Calico with the following command.

kubectl apply -f \
https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.2/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/calico.yaml


Step 10:- Confirm that all of the pods are running with the following command.Note that this takes time, so please watch it for few minutes.Make sure you see all the pods as running, it takes a bit of time for the control plane to get ready

watch kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

Step 11:- Confirm that the master node is in ready status using the below command

kubectl get nodes

Step 12:- Setup worker nodes and join them to master, To do this, follow the Install Docker steps completely and follow the Install Kubernetes steps till Step 4.Follow these steps as many times depending on the number of worker nodes you need, which basically is a new VM.

Step 13:- Join token

In my case, this is what the token looked like, please use your own token which gets created when you run kubeadm.

kubeadm join 172.31.25.97:6443 --token t0mt55.hg8ib424gow5kcj8 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:7f5bb869a80f5731959702f0d72507f9e5ad27f2f12f2c0013e25edaa92109e3

Step 14:- If you have lost the token and not able to find it, you can run the below command and get the token


kubeadm token create --print-join-command

Step 15: Go Back to master and execute the below command.You should see that the master and the worker are in ready status.

kubectl get nodes

# Dockerfile

Step 1:- To build the docker image you need to create a Dockerfile. Make sure the Dockerfile and test.sh are in the same directory as test.sh will be used in the dockerfile for execution.

Step 2:- Run the below command to build the docker image

docker build -t drupal-test:v1 .

Step 3:- Use the image to run the container

docker run -it -p 80:80 --name drupal-test drupal-test:v1

or 

docker run -d -p 80:80 --name drupal-test drupal-test:v1


Here if we use -it , then its interactive mode and you can check the whole process.If you use -d , then its background mode and you will only see the docker container id

One of the issues that i am facing, it takes time for the drupal page to show up, so would request you to refresh the page and wait for 5-10 minutes

First try to hit the below url to see whether the ubuntu apache page is loading

http://hostname

Next, try the below page

http://hostname/drupal


Database: drupal

User: drupaluser

Password: password



# Kubernetes-deployment

Step 1:-To run it as a kubernetes deployment, use the below command

kubectl create -f drupal-deployment.yaml -n app

Step 2:- To check the deployment

kubectl get deployments -n app

Step 3:-To check the pods

kubectl get pods -n app

Step 4:- To expose the service


Step 5:-Expose the deployment and create a service, you can also create a service using yaml file, but for now, i would prefer the below command


kubectl expose deployment deployment-name --type=NodePort --name=deployment-name-service

Change the deployment name and deployment service.Also the type could be NodePort or ClusterIP or Loadbalancer.


# ELK

# Elasticsearch

Use ELK for log monitoring.



Make sure you have java installed,if not use the below commands, by becoming root

add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
apt-get update -y
apt-get -y install oracle-java8-installer
java -version



Step 1:- Elasticsearch
We need to download elasticsearch zip file

wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-6.4.2.zip

unzip elasticsearch-6.4.2.zip

cd elasticsearch-6.4.2/

chmod 775 *


Step 2:- Go to config folder inside elasticsearch, and open elasticsearch.yml.Add the following or edit it in the file.Change the network.host based on your host ip.

cluster.name: drupal-test

node.name: master-node

bootstrap.system_call_filter: false

network.host: 10.199.11.48

http.port: 920

Step 3:-
Go to the below path and open the file

vi /etc/security/limits.conf

Add the below value.In your case , the user might be different, just type whoami and check the user.

user  -  nofile  262144

Then do a reload

systemctl daemon-reload


Also edit the jvm.options

-Xms2g
-Xmx2g

Step 4:- Go to bin folder and run the below command

nohup ./elasticsearch &

ps -ef| grep elasticsearch


# Kibana

Download steps
 
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-6.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz 

tar -xzf kibana-6.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

cd kibana-6.4.2-linux-x86_64/ 


Go to kibana.yaml file and edit these changes

server.port: 5601

server.host: "10.199.11.48"

server.name: "drupal-kibana"

elasticsearch.url: "http://10.199.11.48:9200"       ## Provide the elasticsearch hostname

pid.file: /opt/elk_test/kibana-6.4.0-linux-x86_64/config/kibana.pid


Go to bin folder,

nohup ./kibana &

Open the kibana console at http://hostname:5601

# Logstash

wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/logstash/logstash-6.4.2.zip

unzip logstash-6.4.2.zip

cd logstash-6.4.2

Go to config and then logstash.conf
Change the following parameter

hosts => ["http://10.199.11.48:9200"]

Edit jvm.options file and change the heap size

-Xms2g
-Xmx2g

Go to bin, and run the following command.

nohup ./logstash -f ../bin/logstash.conf &


# Filebeat

wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-6.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

tar -xvf filebeat-6.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

cd filebeat-6.4.2

Step 1:- Open filebeat.yml and do the following changes.

enabled: true

paths:

    - /admin/reports/dblog/*.log
	
setup.dashboards.enabled: true

setup.kibana:

  host: "10.199.11.48:5601
  
output.logstash:

  hosts: ["10.199.11.48:5044"]
  
  
Step 2:- Run the following command

chmod 775 *

nohup ./filebeat -e -c filebeat.yml &

For Kubernetes,Docker and ELK installation, its the official guide for these, but since i have worked on it , i know the setup beforehand and didnt really lookup for the docs online as those are misleading


# Helm Install
